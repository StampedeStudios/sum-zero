**Sum Zero** is a mobile puzzle game where the player has to bring all the tiles on a grid down to zero using math-based sliders. The game involves strategy, logic, and basic arithmetic to solve each level.

## Concept
In **Sum Zero**, players are presented with a grid of tiles that can vary in size from 2x2 up to 5x5 cells and each shape in between those sizes. Each tile contains a number between -4 and 4. The player's goal is to manipulate these numbers using sliders to make every tile on the grid equal to zero.

### Key Mechanics
- **Grid Size**: Levels range from a 2x2 grid to a 5x5 grid, providing increasing difficulty as the grid size grows.
- **Tile Values**: Each tile can have an initial value between -4 and 4.
- **Sliders**: Sliders are positioned on the sides of the grid and apply operations to a row or column of tiles. The available slider operations include:
  - **Add 1**: Increases the value of each tile in the selected row or column by 1.
  - **Remove 1**: Decreases the value of each tile in the selected row or column by 1.
  - **Invert Sign**: Multiplies the value of each tile in the selected row or column by -1 (positive becomes negative and vice versa).
  - **Block Tile**: Sets each tile in a row or colum to 0 and prevents any further slider from affecting it.

### How to Play
1. At the start of each level, the grid is populated with tiles containing values between -4 and 4.
2. Use the sliders on the grid's sides to manipulate the rows and columns.
3. Try to find the optimal combination of slider movements to bring every tile's value to 0.
4. Some tiles may be blocked, some may be missing.
5. Once all tiles are set to zero, the level is complete!

### Challenges
- With increasing grid sizes, finding the right sequence of slider movements becomes more complex.
- The puzzle requires logical thinking, as certain moves may seem beneficial at first but complicate the puzzle in later steps.

## Game Features
- Varying grid sizes (from 2x2 to 5x5) for different difficulty levels.
- A range of mathematical sliders to manipulate the tiles.
- Strategic decision-making: Blocking tiles and deciding the best sequence of operations is key to solving the puzzle efficiently.
- Minimalistic yet challenging gameplay with endless possibilities for level design.
