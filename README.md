## Concept
**Sum Zero** is a mobile puzzle game where players use math-based sliders to bring all tiles on a grid down to zero. Combining strategy, logic, and arithmetic, each level presents a unique challenge to solve.

Players navigate grids ranging in size from 2x2 to 5x5. Each tile has a number between -4 and 4, and the goal is to manipulate these numbers using sliders to make every tile equal to zero.

### Key Mechanics
- **Dynamic Grids**: Levels vary in size, from 2x2 to 5x5, with difficulty scaling as grids grow larger.
- **Tile Values**: Tiles start with values between -4 and 4, requiring careful planning to neutralize.
- **Slider Operations**:
  - **Add 1**: Increases all tile values in a row or column by 1.
  - **Remove 1**: Decreases all tile values in a row or column by 1.
  - **Invert Sign**: Multiplies all tile values in a row or column by -1 (positive becomes negative and vice versa).
  - **Block Tile**: Sets all tile values in a row or column to 0, preventing further slider effects.

### How to Play

#### Analyze the level
Use sliders positioned along the grid's edges to manipulate rows or columns. Not every row or column has a slider. Begin the level with a grid of tiles displaying values from -4 to 4. 

#### Plan a sequence of moves
Each level can be of different shape on a max of a 4 by 4 size. Strategically sequence slider movements to reduce all tile values to zero executing the lower number of moves possible. 

#### Minimize moves amount
Deal with blocked or missing tiles that may appear as additional obstacles. Complete the level once all tiles display a value of zero.

### Where to play
Play **Sum Zero** on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.stampede.sumzero) for the best experience. If you prefer a desktop experience, you can download a playable version for [Linux](https://github.com/StampedeStudios/sum-zero/releases/download/1.05/SumZero_Linux.zip) or [Windows](https://github.com/StampedeStudios/sum-zero/releases/download/1.05/SumZero_Windows.zip). You can also play it on [itch.io](https://stampede-studios.itch.io/sum-zero) if you just want to give it a quick try.

## Features
- **Varied Difficulty**: Grids range from simple 2x2 layouts to challenging 5x5 puzzles. Larger grids increase complexity, requiring more strategic planning and foresight;
- **Math-Based Game play**: Leverage arithmetic sliders to manipulate tile values and solve puzzles.
- **Strategic Thinking**: Plan sequences of moves to clear levels efficiently while navigating blocked tiles and other constraints. Some sliders may initially seem helpful but create complications for future moves.
- **Minimalist Design**: Focused game play with endless potential for creative level designs.
